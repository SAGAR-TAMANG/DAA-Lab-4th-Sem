2. Write a C program which will find out the consecutive X numbers from an array of size N.

For Example: 
if the inputs are
- length > 5 
- numbers are > 10, 30, 40, 20, 50

The output will be "Nothing Found"

For Example 2:
if the inputs are:
- length > 5
- numbers > 2, 3, 4, 9, 8

The output will be: 2, 3, 4

For Example 3:
if the inputs are:
- length > 8
- numbers > 1, 9, 8, 5, 6, 4, 19, 2

The output will be: 5, 6
